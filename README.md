# SQL
My SQL project involved creating an ERD among 10 tables and answering questions such as which employees should get a bonus, worst product, top customers, and decreasing costs. I wrote code, explained it, showed tables and made recommendations for company improvement. It highlights my SQL proficiency and data analysis skills.
